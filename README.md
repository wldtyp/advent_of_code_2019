My solutions to Advent of Code 2019!

Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge that takes place in December of each year. 
Problems are released each day leading up to the 25th. You can find out more and participate here: https://adventofcode.com

Since Python 2 officially reached end of life on January 1, 2020. I set out to solve the 2019 problems using Python 3. My aim was to leverage the Python standard library as much as possible and maybe learn some things along the way.

You can run the solution for a given day like so:

```
python day_n.py input.txt
```
